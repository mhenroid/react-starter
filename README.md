# Technologies

## Development Environment

- Node.js - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  
- Gulp - Used to automate the build process (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- Browserify - Used to bundle all JavaScript files into a single bundle.js file (http://browserify.org/)
- Babel - A JavaScript compiler used to compile the latest ECMAScript 2015(ES2015) JavaScript code into ECMAScript 6 more widely supported by modern web browsers (https://babeljs.io/). 
- Eslint - A linting utility for JavaScript and JSX (http://eslint.org/)
- Jest - A unit testing framework created by Facebook for React (https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Website
- React - The React JavaScript library v0.14.7 (https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- React Router - A routing library that works with React (https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
- Flux - One of several possible application architectures used for building React applications (https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
- Material UI - A UI framework built on top of React and Google's Material Design project (http://www.material-ui.com/)
- Bootstrap - A popular HTML, CSS and JS framework for building responsive web applications (http://getbootstrap.com/)
- JSData - Framework for communicating with backend (i.e. RESTful services)



# Build Environment / Gulp

Gulp (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) is one of many available tools to automate the build process.  Other alternatives include Grunt, Brunch, and Webpack.  

The gulpfile.js is used to configure the tasks that automate the build process.  Below are some example commands that you can run:

## Gulp Configuration

The gulpfile.js file contains a 'config' section where you can modify high level configurations for the  build process.  You may also need to customize various gulp tasks in the gulpfile.js for your project. Gulp has good documentation available at http://gulpjs.com/ and https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp.  


## Build and Launch Development Web Server
Perform build of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Also launches a development web server at http://localhost:8080 and uses gulp-watch to automatically refresh the page whenever a changes is made to .js, .html or .scss files.

## Perform a build of JavaScript, HTML and CSS
````
gulp build
````

## Performs a build of JavaScript, HTML and CSS for production environment.
````
gulp build-prod
